# Multiboard-io

This webapp was originally made for me and my friends to play the boardgame "Sorry!" but I kept adding to it until it became an interactive, real time platform to play any boardgame that met certain requirements. 

Multiboard is currently hosted at http://multiboard-io.herokuapp.com/ and features the games Sorry, ludo, and an original game.

There is a full chat and command system, automatic lobby creation, and interactive board elements such as cards, dice, and real-time moveable pieces.

The platform was designed so that it is relatively simple to add new games.
